# Installing Git on computers

# Install on Windows
# Download Git bash from https://git-scm.com/ External link

# When asked to choose the default editor for Git, we 
# recommend choosing nano if you do not already know VIM.

# The "git and optional Unix tools from Windows" option 
# will allow you to learn Unix from Rstudio, however, it 
# might interfere with the Windows command line.

# Finally, change the Rstudio preference so that you 
# are using Git bash as the terminal (only for Windows user).

# Install on Mac
# Open the terminal, either from the utility folder or 
# using Cmd+space, and check if you already have Git 
# installed by typing git --version in the command line.

# If you already have Git installed, you will be shown
# the version number after executing the above. If you 
# do not have Git installed already, you will be prompted
# to do so.
